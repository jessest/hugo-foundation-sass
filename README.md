# hugo-foundation-sass

This is an open source Hugo theme based on [Hugo foundation](https://github.com/hdcdstr8fwd/foundation-theme) and [JointsWP]https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP).

I modified the theme to suit my preferred base with a more modular theme, Sass, and a gulp routine. 

- To Install 

Download and install current Hugo binary as specified on the Hugo Docs website
run
	$ hugo new site example

then in your themes dir run

	$ https://github.com/jessest/hugo-foundation-sass

Use the config.toml in the themes/examplesite to understand how to configure and use this theme.
